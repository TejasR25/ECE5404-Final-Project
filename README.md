# ECE5404-Final-Project
Final project for ECE5404 - Principal Component Analysis for Network Intrusion Detection
The system provides a robust defense mechanism against various threats by continuously monitoring network traffic and analyzing patterns. In this project, we implemented a binary classification module to classify normal versus attack conditions.
